## **Wireshark Network Analysis Projects**

This repository contains four hands-on projects focused on analyzing different types of network traffic using Wireshark. Each project demonstrates a specific protocol or technique and includes `.pcap` files, screenshots, and analysis notes.

### üì° Wireshark Projects Included:

1. [Project 1 - HTTP Packet Analysis](./Project%201%20-%20HTTP%20Packet%20Analysis/README.md)  
   Captures and explains the client-server communication process in a standard HTTP web session.

2. [DNS AAAA Query Analysis](./DNS%20AAAA%20Query%20Analysis/README.md)  
   Breaks down IPv6-based DNS query and response behavior during domain resolution.

3. [TCP 3-Way Handshake Deep Dive](./TCP%203-Way%20Handshake%20Deep%20Dive/README.md)  
   Detailed analysis of the TCP connection establishment process using SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets.

4. [ICMP Echo Request and Reply Analysis](./ICMP-Echo-Analysis)
   Analyzed ICMP traffic using Wireshark to understand how Echo Request and Echo Reply work in `ping` operations.
