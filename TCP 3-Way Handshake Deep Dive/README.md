# Wireshark TCP 3-Way Handshake Deep Dive

This project provides a practical analysis of the TCP 3-Way Handshake using Wireshark. It is part of my cybersecurity documentation focused on **network intrusion detection and analysis**.

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- Capture of the TCP connection initiation process
- Deep inspection of SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets
- Explanation of TCP session setup
- Screenshots showing flag-level breakdowns
- `.pcapng` capture file for further review

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `tcp-handshake-analysis.docx` – Full documentation
- `tcp-3way-handshake.pcapng` – Packet capture file
- `screenshots/` – Annotated images of the handshake process

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How TCP establishes reliable connections
- How to filter and track sessions using Wireshark
- How SYN, ACK, and sequence numbers coordinate connections

---

## 🚀 Next Step

I'll continue exploring ICMP, ARP, and intrusion detection signatures in packet behavior.
