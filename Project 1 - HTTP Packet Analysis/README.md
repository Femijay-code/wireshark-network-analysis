### 📁 Repository: `wireshark-http-analysis`

## 🛰️ Project Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of HTTP protocol behavior using Wireshark. It simulates real-world network communication between a client and a web server, capturing and interpreting packet-level data to understand request-response patterns.

The goal is to identify HTTP-specific flags, detect anomalies, and extract useful metadata, all of which reflect foundational skills in network traffic inspection and intrusion detection.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

* Capture network traffic during a simulated HTTP request.
* Apply filters to isolate and study HTTP traffic.
* Analyze individual packet flows (e.g., GET requests, response codes, content-type).
* Interpret key flags and TCP behaviors associated with HTTP.
* Document the analysis with screenshots and observations.

## 🧰 Tools Used

* **Wireshark** (packet capture and analysis)
* **Browser** (for generating traffic)
